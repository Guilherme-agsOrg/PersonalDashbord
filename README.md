 # Personal Project - PersonalDashbord

This is a personal project where I am creating a monorepo with a Next.js frontend using Tailwind CSS and a .NET Core backend. The goal is to gradually build a dashboard and add new areas over time.

## Technologies Used:
- **Frontend**: Next.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: .NET Core

## Project Overview:
The first area to be implemented in the dashboard will be the **Finance** section. Future areas will be added as the project evolves.
